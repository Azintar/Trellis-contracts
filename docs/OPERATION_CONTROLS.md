# Operation Controls

 This document covers the shared control primitives for expensive Trellis operations, failed-operation recovery, semantic validation, and dependency health.

## Rate Limits and Abuse Controls

Use `shared::quota::check_and_consume` for normal rate limits and `shared::abuse::record_abuse` for suspicious rejected attempts. Quota state is keyed by `(actor, resource)`. Abuse state is also keyed by `(actor, resource)` and decays over ledger windows.

Suggested resource symbols:

| Resource | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `aid_crt` | Aid creation and escrow funding |
| `reb` | Rebalancer execution |
| `claim` | Claim/refund settlement |
| `oracle` | Oracle submissions |

## Emergency Circuit Breaker

The shared circuit breaker lets an admin pause risky operation families without disabling safe reads or unrelated flows. Scopes are stable symbols defined in `shared::circuit_breaker`:

| Scope constant | Symbol | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SCOPE_AID_CREATION` | `aid_crt` | Aid creation and escrow funding |
| `SCOPE_CLAIM_SETTLEMENT` | `claim` | Claim/refund settlement |
| `SCOPE_REBALANCE` | `reb` | Rebalancer execution |
| `SCOPE_TREASURY` | `treasury` | Treasury withdrawals and deposits |
| `SCOPE_IMPORT` | `import` | Bulk import execution |
| `SCOPE_ORACLE` | oracle | Oracle submissions |

Entry points:

- `pause_scope(env, scope)` — admin-only, pauses a single operation family.
- `resume_scope(env, scope)` — admin-only, restores a single operation family.
- `pause_all(env)` / `resume_all(env)` — admin-only bulk-pause for incident response.
- `is_scope_paused(env, scope)` — safe read for dashboards and monitoring.
- `require_not_paused(env, scope)` — guard to call at the top of a mutating entry point.

Paused operations fail with the stable `shared::Error::Paused` code. Unauthorized pause/resume calls fail with the standard auth error. Every pause and resume emits a `CONTRACT_PAUSED` or `CONTRACT_RESUMED` ledger event carrying the affected scope symbol.

## Recovery Center

When a user-facing operation fails after intent is known, call `shared::recovery::open_recovery`. Frontends can query records with `list_recoveries` and show a pending, retried, resolved, or cancelled status.

## Semantic Validation

Use `shared::semantic` before storage writes and cross-contract calls:

- `validate_amount` for min/max amount rules.
- `validate_distinct_parties` for donor/recipient, buyer/seller, and caller/target checks.
- `validate_future_expiry` for bounded future ledger windows.

## Transaction Preflight

Run `shared::preflight` before signing or submitting a high-risk operation (treasury withdrawal, escrow release/refund, upgrade, migration resume, rebalance, batch invoke). `preflight` is a pure function of typed facts — it returns `Ready`, `Warning`, or `Blocked` checks with a user-safe message and a remediation step, and `require_preflight` guards an entry point with the shared error codes. See [`docs/PREFLIGHT.md`](./PREFLIGHT.md) for the full check table and determinism notes.

## Dependency Health

Use `shared::health` to publish contract-visible assumptions about external dependencies such as RPC, oracle feeds, indexers, and wallets. The health record tracks latest status, last checked ledger, last successful ledger, and failure count.

For user-facing availability states, use [`shared::public_status`](./PUBLIC_STATUS.md). It exposes bounded `Operational`, `Degraded`, `Paused`, and `Maintenance` states with fixed public reason codes, reports `Unknown` until initialized, and requires admin authorization for updates.
